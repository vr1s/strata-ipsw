## what is this

a library that isn't useful to you yet

## how do i build it

clone with submods.

this c-lib-ifies https://github.com/blacktop/ipsw. So install go build tools.
see libipsw/CONTRIBUTING.md if some other go build thing isn't working.

then just run cmake and it should work.

obviously won't work on windows yet.
